# Forecasting-Revenue-via-Time-Series-Forecasting
This project was associated with my work as a data analyst at Bennett Coleman and Co. Ltd. (Times Group). I had Implemented a combination of time series forecasting and statistical modeling to forecast the revenue grossed across various business segments and verticals, helping the sales team to push de-growing agents. I dropped the 2020 fiscal year because it was an outlier year, and I trained the model using data from the previous ten years. Choosing a 99% quantile allowed me to exclude the outlier values. With a MAPE as low as 1.09%, I used Holt Winters' additive method to forecast the revenue.
